# Music-Event-Project---Figma
The project is a platform for music events that provides users with personalized information about concerts and events based on their musical preferences. Additionally, the platform offers features for social interaction and planning, helping users discover new events and organize visits with friends and other fans. It enables the creation of group chats for specific events, where participants can discuss details, exchange information, and share their excitement. Figma was used for the design process.
